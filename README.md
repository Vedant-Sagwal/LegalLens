The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent, multi-agent system that automates the reading, analysis, clause extraction, and summarization of legal documents—making legal information more accessible, understandable, and actionable for everyone. By reducing dependency on costly legal expertise and removing barriers to understanding complex legal texts, this project aims to empower individuals, legal aid centers, and public institutions to make informed decisions quickly and confidently. In doing so, it actively contributes to SDG 16 by promoting access to justice, institutional transparency, and strengthening the rule of law—especially for communities with limited resources. This system is more than just a tool—it's a step toward a fairer, more just society where no one is left behind due to the complexity of legal language.
